I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of Prof. Qing Li, with co-supervision from Prof. Xiaoyong Wei and Prof. Zhen Lei. I completed my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees at Sichuan University, where I developed a strong foundation in computer science and related fields. My research interests primarily focus on image generation and data mining.
